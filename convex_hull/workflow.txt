Three steps are needed for calculating the possible points using a convex hull approach:

1. Compiling the C Program:
  - g++ -std=c++1y convexhull.cpp#
2. Executing the resulting binary:
    - You need the two text files, containing x and y coordinates and the corresponding labels/ values in those text files
    - Machine Made File: machine.txt
    - Human Made File: human.txt
    - Maximum difference for two points in the value of the first text file to be considered similar: max (default 0.1)
    - Maximum Manhattan Distance between two points in order to be in a neighborhood: dist (default 800)
    - Output file: out.text (In its current form, the output file will consist of an unordered list of points with a cluster for each point, a single point can be included multiple times with different clusters)
    -  cat machine.txt human.txt |./a.out max dist > output.txt
3. Execute the generate_convex_png.py script
